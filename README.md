## Install docker

### Docker for Windows

* set up your PATH environment properly

#### Shared folder

use that shared folder in your docker compose file:

	volumes:
		- /projectname:/some/dir/in/container/project_name
    
### or Docker for Windows

* install Docker for Windows 
	

### Docker configuration
		
Create your docker-compose environment file ".env" in `docker` directory

* initialize `SQL_SCRIPTS_FOLDER` variable

# Composer

```
composer config platform.php 8.0.7

docker run -it --rm -v %cd%:/app composer status
```

# Shared hosting

Always avoid putting anything except the applicationâ€™s public files into a document root directory, such as _public\_html_, _htdocs_ or similar.

When working with application configuration, never expose sensitive configuration files in public. To avoid that, place the configuration files outside the publicly accessible document root on the server, so they are not accessible over web https://example.com/config/config.yml
